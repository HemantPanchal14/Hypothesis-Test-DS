# Hypothesis Test-DS
Learning Hypothesis Test-Case Study
Hypothesis testing i an idea that is suggested as the possible explanation for something but has not yet been found to be true or correct
We make many ASSUMPTION,but if we want to verify that our all assumption are RIGHT or WRONG, for that we use Hypothesis Test
Hypothesis Test are of TWO type 1) Null Hypothesis Test=Ho and 2) Alternet Hypothesis Test=Ha
Status quo = Current state <- Null Hypothesis test, i.e. Condition which leads to existing situation and condition which leads to change is Alternet Hypotest

Remember: TYPES OF ERRORS
1) TYPE-1 = Error means rejecting the NULL hypothesis when it's ACTUALLY ' TRUE '.
2) TYPE-2 = Error means accepted the NULL hypothesis when it's ACTUALLY ' FALSE '.
From above both TYPE-1 error is very ' Worse'
